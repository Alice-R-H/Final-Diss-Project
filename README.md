This GitHub repository provides the source code for my final year project. 

A self-proposed final year project to build a high-fidelity prototype of an application capable of analysing player behaviour in the FPS game VALORANT. Developed using Visual Studio and tested using a local database built with Entity Framework and SQLite, analyses were presented within a modern and accessible UI leveraging innovative methods for data visualisation. 

To maintain ethical standards, real player data could not be used; instead, synthetic datasets were designed. Population of the database involved trend injection and logarithmic scaling to produce realistic and testable data to demonstrate the efficacy of the final product.
